# Zorvivor Game
My text-based adventure game that uses the design patterns and OOP I made that while learning object-oriented programming.
You can choose one of 3 characters and join this world full of adventure, fight creatures, collect rewards and get power-ups from the in-game store. The aim of the game is to collect rewards from each arena and reach all the rewards at the end of the game to finish the game. Have a good game.
